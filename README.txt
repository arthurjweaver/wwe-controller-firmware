This directory holds W2 controller firmware code and binaries.

Symlinks pointing to short versions of the binary file names were created manually and should persist
across updates. Short version file names are REQUIRED by the firmware!
  % ln -s wwe.ino.arduino_due_x.bin wwe.bin
  % ln -s updatefw.ino.arduino_due_x.bin updatefw.bin

Permissions for all files in this directory should be 755:
